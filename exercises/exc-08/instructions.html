		<h1>Exercise 8</h1>

		<p>Exercise 8 consists of 7 small tasks. The tasks are found in separate folders: <code>exercise-8.1</code> to <code>exercise-8.7</code>. In each folder you find a file <code>exercise.htm</code> and a screen-shot <code>solution.png</code>. You will have to modify the CSS of the HTML page, so that boxes on the pages are positioned like on the screen-shot.

		<p>Do not forget <strong>clear: both</strong>!</p>
